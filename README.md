## Machine Learning Project

This project is part of the Machine Learning course in a Master's program in Computer Engineering.

The goal of the project is to develop a Machine Learning model to classify messages posted on Twitter as either positive or negative. The reference dataset, containing English-language tweets, is not part of this repo.

It is required to evaluate the accuracy of the models using validation data extracted from the dataset, experimenting with at least two different model configurations (e.g., varying the input text fragment length or vocabulary size). Additionally, test the model's performance on personal tweets.
